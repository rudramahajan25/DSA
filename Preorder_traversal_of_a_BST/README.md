# Preorder traversal of a BST

# Preorder traversal of a BST
## **Problem statement**
**Send feedback**
You have been given an array/list 'PREORDER' representing the preorder traversal of a BST with 'N' nodes. All the elements in the given array have distinct values.
Your task is to construct a binary search tree that matches the given preorder traversal.
A binary search tree (BST) is a binary tree data structure that has the following properties:
```
• The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with data less than the node’s data.
• The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with data greater than the node’s data.
• Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
```
Note:
```
It is guaranteed that a BST can be always constructed from the given preorder traversal. Hence, the answer will always exist.
```
**Example:**
```
From PREORDER = [20, 10, 5, 15, 13, 35, 30, 42] , the following BST can be constructed:

**Constraints :**
**`1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 5000
0 <= data <= 10^5
Where 'data' denotes data contained in the nodes of the binary search tree.
