## **Problem statement**
**Send feedback**
Create a stack data structure that allows operations such as push (adding an element), pop (removing the top element), top (retrieving the top element), and also provides a way to retrieve the minimum element in constant time.
Implement the following public functions :
```
1. push(data) :
This function should take one argument of type integer. It pushes the element into the stack and returns nothing.
2. pop() :
It pops the element from the top of the stack and returns nothing.
3. top() :
It returns the element being kept at the top of the stack.
4.  getMin() :
It returns the smallest element present in the stack.
```
**Operations Performed on the Stack:**
```
Query-1(Denoted by an integer 1): Pushes integer data to the stack. (push function)
Query-2(Denoted by an integer 2): Pops the data kept at the top of the stack. (pop function)
Query-3(Denoted by an integer 3): Fetches and returns the data being kept at the top of the stack. (top function)
Query-4(Denoted by an integer 4): Returns the smallest element present in the stack. (getMin() function)
```

**Sample Input 1:**
**`6
1 13
1 47
3
1 8
2
4`
Sample Output 1:**
**`47
13`
Explanation of Input 1:**
**`Here we have six queries in total.
Query 1: Integer 1 represents the push function. Hence we push element ‘13’ onto the stack.
Query 2: Integer 1 represents the push function. Hence we push element ‘47’ onto the stack.
Query 3: Integer 3 represents the top function. Hence we print the top element in stack i.e. '47'.
Query 4: Integer 1 represents the push function. Hence we push element ‘8’ onto the stack.
Query 5: Integer 2 represents the pop function. The stack contains element ‘8’ at the top. We remove/pop ‘8’ from the stack and we have 13, 47 left in stack.
Query 6: Integer 4 represents the getMin function. Hence the min of current stack is '13'.`
Sample Input 2:**
**`8
1 45
2
1 53
4
1 46
4
2
4`
Sample Output 2:**
**`53
46
53`
Constraints:**
**`1 <= 'Q' <= 1000
1 <= query type <= 4
-10^9 <= data <= 10^9 and data != -1
where 'Q' is the total number of queries being performed on the stack and 'data' represents the integer pushed into the stack.
Operations like pop, top and getMin  will always be called on non-empty stacks.
