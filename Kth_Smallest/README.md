# Kth Smallest

# Kth Smallest
Given an array **arr[]** and an integer **k** where k is smaller than the size of the array, the task is to find the **kth smallest** element in the given array.
**Follow up:** Don't solve it using the inbuilt sort function.
**Examples :**
```
Input:arr[] = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15], k = 3
Output:  7
Explanation:3rd smallest element in the given array is 7.
```
```
Input:arr[] = [2, 3, 1, 20, 15], k = 4
Output: 15
Explanation:4th smallest element in the given array is 15.
```
**Expected Time Complexity:** O(n+(max_element) )
**Expected Auxiliary Space:** O(max_element)
**Constraints:**1 <= arr.size <= 1061<= arr[i] <= 1061 <= k <= n
