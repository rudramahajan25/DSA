# Implement Deque

# Implement Deque
Notes: in leetcode when size = 1 then runtime error divide by zero  (front != 0 && rear == (front-1)%(size-1)
Design a data structure to implement deque of size ‘N’. It should support the following operations:
```
pushFront(X): Inserts an element X in the front of the deque. Returns true if the element is inserted, otherwise false.
pushRear(X): Inserts an element X in the back of the deque. Returns true if the element is inserted, otherwise false.
popFront(): Pops an element from the front of the deque. Returns -1 if the deque is empty, otherwise returns the popped element.
popRear(): Pops an element from the back of the deque. Returns -1 if the deque is empty, otherwise returns the popped element.
getFront(): Returns the first element of the deque. If the deque is empty, it returns -1.
getRear(): Returns the last element of the deque. If the deque is empty, it returns -1.
isEmpty(): Returns true if the deque is empty, otherwise false.
isFull(): Returns true if the deque is full, otherwise false.
```
Following types of queries denote these operations:
```
Type 1: for pushFront(X) operation.
Type 2: for pushRear(X) operation.
Type 3: for popFront() operation.
Type 4: for popRear() operation.
Type 5: for getFront() operation.
Type 6: for getRear() operation.
Type 7: for isEmpty() operation.
Type 8: for isFull() operation.
```

**Constraints:**
**`1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= Q <= 10^5 
1 <= P <= 8
1 <= X <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1 sec
Where ‘N’ represents the size of the deque, ‘Q’ represents the number of queries, ‘P’ represents the type of operation and ‘X’ represents the element.`**
**Sample Input 1:**
```
5 7
7
1 10
1 20
2 30
5
4
4
```
**Sample Output 1:**
```
True
True
True
True
20
30
10
```
**Explanation 1:**
```
For the given input, we have the number of queries, Q = 7.
Operations performed on the deque are as follows:
isEmpty(): Deque is initially empty. So, this returns true.
pushFront(10): Insert the element ‘10’ in the front of the deque. This returns true.
pushFront(20): Insert the element ‘20’ in the front of the deque. This returns true.
pushRear(30): Insert the element ‘30’ in the back of the deque. This returns true.
getFront(): Returns the front element of the deque i.e. 20
popRear(): Pop an element from the back of the deque. This returns 30.
popRear(): Pop an element from the back of the deque. This returns 10.
